    <h3 class="link-heading">The biggest wins were : </h3>

    <li class="bullets"> Getting the <u>API automated testing Suite</u>  up and running in all envs.</li>

    <li class="bullets"><u>Splitting the UI automation suite</u> into two equal halves to cut back on the suite execution time</li>

    <li class="bullets"><u>Being able to schedule the Jenkins jobs </u> at a specific time so that the team does not need to login via VPN and even avoid using VPN if there are any issues when trying to kickoff the autosuite.</li>

    <li class="bullets">Created Auto tests for projects right <u> before they got into production. </u> Typically in UAT phase as opposed to the previous practice of creating the tests after release</li>

    <li class="bullets">Adding the <u>newly created API methods(Eg: Policy Payee) into the API automated testing suite </u> right after we release them. </li>
